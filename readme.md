# London Landlord Licensing Data

This is a Work In Progress project to gather and centralise data on licensing for Landlords in London Boroughs.

It is a project by volunteers from [United Tech & Allied Workers](https://utaw.tech) on behalf of the [London Renters Union](https://londonrentersunion.org/).

# How does it work?

In the current phase of the project, we want to extract all the data we can from each borough and dump it into a CSV for each. Once we have them all we can work out a shared format and do a second pass to convert them all into the same format.

For each borough that still needs doing there is a task on the board here: https://www.notion.so/utawvolunteers/Landlord-licensing-data-gathering-13f3606a993c444e8400c57932644607 (if you don't have access to the notion, you can get it via the #tech-volunteering channel in the UTAW discord)

Once you pick up a task, it's up to you how to write the script. You can have a look at existing ones in the scripts directory above, but the format of the data varies enough from borough to borough that they're likely to all look pretty different.

When you have it working, put up a pull request including the results CSV.
