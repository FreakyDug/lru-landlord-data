# London Landlord Licensing Data

This is a Work In Progress project to gather and centralise data on licensing for Landlords in London Boroughs.

It is a project by volunteers from [United Tech & Allied Workers](https://utaw.tech) on behalf of the [London Renters Union](https://londonrentersunion.org/).

# How does it work?

Good question! We're still figuring that out...
